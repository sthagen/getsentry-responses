0.13.2
------

* Fixed incorrect type stubs for `add_callback`

0.13.1
------

* Fixed packages not containing type stubs.

0.13.0
------

* `responses.upsert()` was added. This method will `add()` a response if one
  has not already been registered for a URL, or `replace()` an existing
  response.
* `responses.registered()` was added. The method allows you to get a list of
  the currently registered responses. This formalizes the previously private
  `responses.mock._matches` method.
* A more useful `__repr__` has been added to `Response`.
* Error messages have been improved.

0.12.1
------

* `responses.urlencoded_params_matcher` and `responses.json_params_matcher` now
  accept None to match empty requests.
* Fixed imports to work with new `urllib3` versions.
* `request.params` now allows parameters to have multiple values for the same key.
* Improved ConnectionError messages.
